**My Experience with proramming** 
*I dont have very much knowledge about the programming world so it is been hard trying to catch up on everything*
**I _really_ feel like I am going to need much help for this class**
I want to study Computer Science because it opens doors to many other things I might want to do in the future. 
~~I am hoping to pass this class with an A~~
